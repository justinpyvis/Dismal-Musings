title: When is a tax cut not really a tax cut?

When is a tax cut not really a tax cut? When it's due to a [bracket change](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/greens-threaten-to-amend-budget-unless-government-dumps-top-end-tax-cuts-20220623-p5aw2f.html):

> Greens leader Adam Bandt is preparing to fight the government over already-legislated tax cuts but has stopped short of threatening the passage of supply bills if Labor doesn't dump them in its October budget.
>
> "The Greens will not support a Labor budget based on cuts that hurt everyday people while continuing the handouts to billionaires." \
> ... \
> Under the stage-three tax cuts, which were legislated in 2018 by then-treasurer Scott Morrison, the 37 per cent tax bracket will be abolished, the top 45 per cent bracket will start from $200,000 and the 32.5 per cent rate will be cut to 30 per cent for all incomes between $45,000 and $200,000.
>
> The cuts are on track to cost the budget $37 billion a year by the early 2030s, according to costings by the Parliamentary Budget Office that the Greens released during the election.

To be clear, "tax cuts" such as these do not "cost" the government anything. It's also not a "handout" to billionaires. It's simply a reindexing to allow people to claw back what's known as "bracket creep", where people pay more in tax over time because the government does not index its income tax brackets to inflation. The last time Australia changed its top tax bracket was in 2008-09 – thirteen years ago – since which the purchasing power of the Australian dollar has declined by around 35%.

Put into the context of taxation, a person who earned $200,000 back in 2008-09 would today be earning $267,325, assuming their salary had kept up with inflation. They would currently pay an effective tax rate of 34.0%, up from 30.3% in 2008-09. Under the proposed "tax cuts", their effective tax rate would fall back down to 30.6%.

In other words, they would still be worse off than they were in 2008-09 and it's unlikely that we'll see another reindexing anytime soon, so bracket creep (the RBA [expects](https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2022/sp-gov-2022-06-21.html) 7% annual inflation by December) will very quickly drive even more of their income into the top 45% bracket, raising their effective tax rate back up to 34% in no time (just four short years at a 7% annual rate of inflation).
